## üìÅ components/

Reusable page/component objects for high-level UI actions.

- **display_settings.ts**  
  Helpers for toggling display settings and language in the app.

- **navbar.ts**  
  Functions to interact with the navigation bar (wait for, click items, close popups).

- **reader_page.ts**  
  Utilities for validating titles and text on the main reader page.

- **search_page.ts**  
  Helpers for typing into the search bar and selecting from search results.

- **topics_page.ts**  
  Functions for navigating and validating the Topics page, including clicking tabs and verifying content.

- **\*.ts**  
  Other component helpers for specific pages or features (such as the Account tab) can be added in the future as needed. For example, you might add `account_page.ts` for account-related actions.

## üìÅ constants/

Centralized error and text constants for consistency.

- **error_constants.ts**  
  Error message templates and logging helpers for assertions and failures.

- **text_constants.ts**  
  Text snippets, Hebrew months, and other static text used in tests.

- **\*.ts**
  Additional constants can be added as needed for specific tests or components.

## üìÅ tests/

Where your actual test suites live.

- **e2e.spec.ts**  
  Main end-to-end test suite. Handles logging, session setup/teardown, and contains all test cases.

- **test_init.ts**  
  Initializes logging and error handling for writing logs to `logs-test/`.

- **\*.spec.ts**
  Additional test files can be created for specific features or components.  
  Each file should follow the same structure as `e2e.spec.ts` with `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, and `it` blocks.

## üìÅ utils/

Helper modules for low-level actions, API calls, and cross-cutting concerns.

- **browserstackUtils.ts**  
  Helpers for interacting with the BrowserStack session API (set session status, report results).

- **gesture.ts**  
  Gesture and scrolling utilities: swipe, scroll, and element search with screen dimension caching.
