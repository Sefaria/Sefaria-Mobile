# Sefaria-iOS
This repo contains the source code and export script to generate the content for Sefaria's [iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sefaria/id1163273965?mt=8). 

We're using React-Native, so much of the app is written in JavaScript. This is unlike our Android app which was built natively, but similar to our Web app which is built with React.

### Getting Started

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
git clone https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-iOS/
cd Sefaria-iOS                          
npm install
npm run setup
gem install cocoapods
cd ios
pod update
pod install
```
Put `GoogleService-Info.plist` in the `ios` directory.  It's available from the Firebase console (or your friendly co-worker.)
_<sub><sup>This step can be skipped if just running for android. Skipping it for ios can get you in trouble though.</sup></sub>_


To build and start the simulator:

From the root of the repo, run `react-native start`.  
From another terminal, run `react-native run-ios`

Alternatively, you can open `/ios/ReaderApp.xcworkspace` and hit run.


## Local Development
It's quite natural to want to test the app against a local instance of Sefaria-Project. This can be done in 2 simple steps:

1. Set `Api._baseHost` to the ip address that your local server is serving from (this has to be the actual ip address displayed by django, not `localhost`).
2. From your home directory, navigate to `Android/Sdk/platform-tools` (or add to `PATH`). Then execute `./adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000`
